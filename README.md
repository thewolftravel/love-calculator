# love-calculator
The Love Calculator is a simple web application that provides users with a playful way to determine the compatibility between two people by calculating a "love score.". 
I developed this project during my journey through the üç∫ London App Brewery's Web Development course.

Tech Stack

The Love Calculator project is built using the following technologies:

HTML: Provides the structure for the web page and user interface.

CSS: Styles the application for an appealing visual presentation.

JavaScript: Drives the logic and calculations behind the Love Calculator. It leverages the Math.random() function to generate random love scores.

You can experience Tindog live by visiting the Live Demo: https://thewolftravel.github.io/love-calculator/

Usage
To use the Love Calculator, simply enter the names of the two individuals you want to calculate the love score for and click the "Calculate Love" button. 
The application will generate a random love score and display the result.
It's all in good fun, and the results are not meant to be taken seriously.

Contribution
Contributions to the Love Calculator project are welcome! 
Whether you want to improve the user interface, enhance the randomization logic, or add additional features, feel free to submit a pull request.

Have fun exploring the world of randomness with the Love Calculator! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíîüòÑ
